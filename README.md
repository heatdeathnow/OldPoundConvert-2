# OldPoundConvert-2.2

 I remake an old program from when I didn't understand how GUIs worked.


# Changes
Fixed unknown bug preventing a frame from being deleted, making it always stay on the background.

Changed the buttons at the settings' screen to checkboxes and reworked it.

Added new conversion option from specific coins.

# Lacking features

More conversion options.
