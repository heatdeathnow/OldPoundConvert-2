 I remake an old program from when I didn't understand how GUIs worked.


# Changes
Fixed unknown bug preventing a frame from being deleted, making it always stay on the background.

Changed the buttons at the settings' screen to checkboxes and reworked it.

Added new conversion option from specific coins.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Added warning pop up if the program is used with all coins disabled.
=======
Added half-groat and third guinea coins.

Fixed typo from "Half Penny" to "Halfpenny".

Added persistency to enabled and disabled coins.

Added hardcoded values to coins in case the conf CSV file is deleted.
