 I remake an old program from when I didn't understand how GUIs worked.

Added the ability to enabled and disable coins from the calculations.

Changed the incorrect fraction from ⅓ to ¼.

Added half-groat and third guinea coins.

Fixed type from "Half Penny" to "Halfpenny".

Added persistency to enabled and disabled coins.

Added hardcoded values to coins in case the conf CSV file is deleted.

# Lacking features

More conversion options.
