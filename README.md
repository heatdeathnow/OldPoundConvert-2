# OldPoundConvert-2.2
 I remake an old program from when I didn't understand how GUIs worked.


# Changes
Fixed unknown bug preventing a frame from being deleted, making it always stay on the background.

Changed the buttons at the settings' screen to checkboxes and reworked it.

Added new conversion option from specific coins.

Added warning pop up if the program is used with all coins disabled.

# Lacking features

More conversion options.
